## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About
CTA (Christmas Tree Application) - is an appplication that allows users to interact with a small database - a list of grandma's decorations.

Each decoration has a name and some information about it (for example, the year of production or shape and color). Users can search for decorations by name, filter by parameters or sort by name or year.

Another feature of this app is the ability to add decorations to your favorites list.

On the second view (Tree view) the user can customize a tree and decorate it with toys, which were added to a favourite list. If user doesn't select any decorations, the first 20 toys are available by default.

*This application was made as a task from RS School. This was my first experience with OOP and TS. TS was nice (apart from the fact that I used too much Type Assertion), but i didn't really like OOP*
